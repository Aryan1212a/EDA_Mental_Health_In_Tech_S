### Data Wrangling

Initial data wrangling steps were performed to clean and prepare the dataset for analysis. This included:

*   Handling missing values in columns such as `state`, `self_employed`, and `work_interfere` through imputation. The `comments` column was also addressed due to a high percentage of missing values.
*   Checking for and confirming no duplicate rows were present.
*   Cleaning and normalizing inconsistent entries in the `Gender` column.
*   Filtering unrealistic values in the `Age` column for visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A comprehensive EDA was conducted to understand the dataset and uncover insights into mental health in the tech industry. Key visualizations and findings include:

*   **Mental Health Treatment Seeking Behavior:** [Summarize key finding from Chart 1]
*   **Age and Gender Distribution:** [Summarize key findings from Chart 2 and Chart 3]
*   **Impact of Company Size and Remote Work:** [Summarize key findings from Chart 4 and Chart 7]
*   **Influence of Workplace Policies (Benefits, Anonymity, Leave):** [Summarize key findings from Chart 8, Chart 9, and Chart 20]
*   **Workplace Stigma and Consequences:** [Summarize key findings from Chart 10, Chart 17, Chart 18, and Chart 19]
*   **Correlation Analysis:** [Summarize key findings from the simplified correlation heatmap (Chart 14), highlighting important relationships]
*   **Other Insights:** [Summarize key findings from remaining charts like Family History (Chart 5), Work Interference (Chart 6), Country Distribution (Chart 11), Wellness Program (Chart 12), and Mental vs Physical Health Views (Chart 13)]
